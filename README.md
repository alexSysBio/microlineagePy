# 🔬 microlineagePy 🔀
This repository contains a set of functions that can be used to link cells into lineages. 

The <code>compute_lineage</code> function inside the <code>lineator.py</code> script is used to link mother and daughter cells into lineages, starting from the older progeny, towards the youngest mother. This function is applied on a dataframe that follows the lineage nonmeclature implemented in my publicly available data: <url>https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/BioImages/studies/S-BIAD1658?query=papagiannakis</url>
